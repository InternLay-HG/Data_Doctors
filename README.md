detection of potential health issues, and recommendations based on AI-driven
analytics.

**Enable Remote Monitoring:** Facilitate remote consultations and monitoring for
healthcare providers.

**Seamless Integration:** Enable smooth data integration with third-party EHRs and
wearable devices.

**Security & Compliance:** Ensure all data is securely managed in compliance with
healthcare standards (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.).


**3. System Architecture**


The architecture of HealthGuardian includes the following key components:

**1. Mobile Application**
Purpose: Daily data input, alerts, and personalized recommendations for
users.
Data Flow: User data input → Backend via API → AI analysis → Response
(recommendations, alerts).

**2. Web Application**
Purpose: Dashboards for users and healthcare providers, telemedicine, and
community support.
Data Flow: User and provider actions → Backend via API → Database → AI
analysis for actionable insights.

**3. AI Backend**
Purpose: Process health data to assess risk, provide recommendations, and
detect early signs of disease.

**4. Data Storage**
Purpose: Secure and structured storage for all user and system data.

**5. Integration Layer**
Purpose: Facilitate data flow between HealthGuardian and external systems
(EHRs, wearables).
